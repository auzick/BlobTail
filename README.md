# BlobTail
Windows application to "tail" log blobs in Azure storage.

The application monitors append blobs in an Azure blob container, and continually displays the text being appended. When a new blob is added to the container, the application automatically switches to that blob.

The application connects to an Azure storage account by connection string.
